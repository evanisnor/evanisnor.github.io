Hi! 👋🏼 My name is Evan. Let me tell you a little about myself!

I'm a software engineer from Nova Scotia. I love learning new things and meeting
new people. I enjoy spending time with my family, playing the guitar, and
trying my hand at songwriting. I love reading; Philosophy, Non-Fiction,
Science-Fiction, History. My passion is building software that people love!

The primary focus for much of my career has been Android development, however, I
have had many opportunities to practice in different areas such as web,
back-end, and dev-ops. I've worked at companies both large and small, on
scrappy teams and on formal teams.

Through all of my experience I have come to appreciate that the best functioning
teams are those who find a way to clearly express their values, whether
implicitly or directly, and that some of the most important things they value
are related to kindness and mutual respect for each other. Creating and
maintaining an environment of trust and wellness is one of the cornerstones of
a successful team, and ultimately a successful project (and product).

A well functioning team cultivates a desire for technical excellence instead of
striving for perfection. Taking the time to share knowledge and communicate
clearly every day will ensure that pertinent skills become widespread and good
ideas become infectious. Giving individuals the autonomy and space to work
through their ideas will keep everyone motivated to bring their best self to
work. Mistakes will be made and the work will be hard, but it's crucial that
one has the support and encouragement of their peers for everyone to be a
success. This cannot be done well if the team does not trust and respect each
other as it requires a kind of thoughtful collaboration that avoids judgement,
criticism, and blame.

I've been lurking on the internet since the late 90's and I haven't taken the
time to share my perspective and experiences. Maybe I should start!
